                <p>Hi, My name is Sakibul Islam, I am currently an Undegraduate Computer Science Student at Queen Mary, University Of London.
                    I have a keen interest in Programming and the Tech space more broadly. I studied Computer Science at both GCSE and A-Level, where 
                    I had my first dable in to the world of programming. 
                </p>
                <p> Having enjoyed it I decided that Software engineering is a good career path for me
                    so I decided to pursue a Degree in Computer Science. I hope to use this time at university to learn the theoretical concepts of Computer 
                    Science be able to use them to learn the skills that will help me become a good Software Engineer.
                </p>

                <h3>PWC Insight Week 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    I took part in the PWC Insight Week in summer 2020. I explored different business areas withing PWC and found out about what kind of 
                    work I would be doing.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In Discover sessions, I was given an overview of each key business area and their place in the organisation
                        </li>
                        <li>In Give It A Go sessions I was given the opportunity to put my knowledge from Discover sessions to work 
                            using it to do typical tasks a graduate in that given area would do day to day.
                        </li>
                        <li>I also had the opportunity to speak to others on the programme through the PWC virtual park. As this was during the Pandemic, it
                            gave me a good networking opportunity in a time where traditional face to face networking was impossible
                        </li>
                    </ul>
